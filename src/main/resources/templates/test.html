						Low Key, who was a grifter from Minnesota, smiled his
						scarred smile. "Yeah," he said. "That's true. It's even
						better when you've been sentenced to death. That's when
						you remember the jokes about the guys who kicked their
						boots off as the noose flipped around their necks,
						because their friends always told them they'd die with
						their boots on."
					</p>
					<p>"Is that a joke?" asked Shadow.</p>

						"When did they last hang a man in this state?" asked
						Shadow.
					</p>
					<p>
						"How the hell should I know?" Lyesmith kept his
						orange-blond hair pretty much shaved. You could see the
						lines of his skull. "Tell you what, though. This country
						started going to hell when they stopped hanging folks.
						No gallows dirt. No gallows deals."
